      <h3>Charter Schools</h3>
      <img src="/images/issues.jpg" class="picture-image" style="float:left" />
      <p>
        Charter schools are public schools that are independently operated. They are tuition-free and open to all students. Charter schools are held
        accountable to state and federal academic standards. They are also held accountable to the promises made in their charter. If a charter school
        does not meet these standards, it may be closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charter schools are a great option for parents who want more involvement in their child's education. They offer a variety of educational
        options, including online learning, project-based learning, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Washington State, charter schools are authorized by the Washington State Charter School Commission. The Commission is responsible for
        approving and overseeing charter schools in Washington State. The Commission is also responsible for ensuring that charter schools are meeting
        the needs of students and families.

      <p>
        There are only 18 charter schools in Washington State. Part of the reason for this is because the the State Charter School Commission is not
        doing enough to authorize charter schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spokane Public Schools have worked around the State Charter School Commission by authorizing their own charter schools. This is a great
        example of how local school districts can take the initiative to authorize charter schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        To become an authorizer, the Longview School District would need to be an approved authorizer by the State Charter School Commission, and to
        do so the school Board need only to go through the application process. The application process is not difficult, and the State Charter School
        Commission is actively looking for more authorizers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem lies in the fact that the <strong>Longview School Board has not taken the initiative to become an authorizer</strong>. The
        Longview School Board has not even discussed the possibility of becoming an authorizer. This is a problem because the Longview School Board is
        not doing enough to provide educational options for students and families.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Robert Kohr Jr</strong>, <strong>Scott Beck</strong>, and <strong>Karis Searcy</strong> are all running to replace the incumbents on
        the Longview School Board. All three candidates support charter schools and will work to make the Longview School District an authorizer.
      </p>
      <h3>Bullying</h3>
      <p>
        Bullying is a serious problem in our schools. The Longview School Board has not done enough to address bullying. Following the direction from
        the state board of education, the Longview School Board has adopted a policy that does not hold students accountable for their actions. This
        policy is not working.
      </p>
      <p>
        The administration doesn't have clear metrics for disciplinary actions, and suspensions and expulsions are rarely used, and when they are
        used, they are not applied in a consistent manner.
