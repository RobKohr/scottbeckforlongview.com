      <h3>Bullying</h3>

      <p>
        The Longview School district has a long history of sever bullying that has persisted for decades and continues still. From lifelong residents
        of past generations I was greeted with astonishment at the thought of willingly enrolling my children here. It has been described as a good
        olâ€™ boys club that sweeps it under the rug and searches for ways to excuse it. I will work to change that by encouraging staff to take
        advantage of policies to hold accountable bullies, by holding staff accountable for their choices and actions/inaction, and by giving parents
        a measure of accountability over the district and individual schools.

      <h3>School Choice</h3>
      <p>
        I support school choice, the first step of this is to establish Charter schools which is not a difficult process, the state board is actively
        looking for school boards to take this initiative but our current board has failed to take this simple step to vastly improve the education
        system in our district. Charter schools offer parents a measure of accountability by giving them an options to chose the school that fits
        their student the best. After establishing charter schools the next step is to restructure so funds to educate children follow the children. I
        am talking about actual school choice, where the funds go with the student to traditional public schools, charter schools, private schools or
        even home schooling.

      <h3>Fiscal Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        In the process of restructuring to allow parents the freedom to hold the district and schools accountable it is my goal to balance the budget
        without relying on renewal of levies for essential school services.
